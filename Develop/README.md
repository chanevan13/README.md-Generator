# <README.md Generator>

## Description
I was motivated to create the README.md Generator because I wanted to make a shortcut when generating a README file instead of tediously typing it out and searching up layouts online. This project creates a shortcut for users to generate a proffesional README file with pre loaded prompts.


## Installation
First, You must clone this repo into your local storage. Then, You must run npm init and npm install inquirer version 8.2.4.


## Usage
After installing all necessary assets. You will need to open the integrated terminal on the file and enter node index.js. After that you will be prompted several README prompts to fill out and you will be done after all are filkle out properly.
